# IM - Infrastructure Manager

IM is a tool that deploys complex and customized virtual infrastructures on IaaS
Cloud deployments (such as AWS, OpenStack, etc.). It eases the access and the
usability of IaaS clouds by automating the VMI (Virtual Machine Image)
selection, deployment, configuration, software installation, monitoring and
update of the virtual infrastructure. It supports APIs from a large number of virtual
platforms, making user applications cloud-agnostic. In addition it integrates a
contextualization system to enable the installation and configuration of all the
user required applications providing the user with a fully functional
infrastructure.
